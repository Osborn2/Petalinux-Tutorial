In this version, we build a Linux kernel using Petalinux (v.2015.4) and .hdf (hardware constraint file generated by SDSoC).
The basic structure of this tutorial shows as following:

1. commands - including some general commands of Petalinux and the specific configuration for our design
2. configs - details about Linux configuration
  1. General configuration 
  2. Kernel configuration
  3. Root file system configuration   
3. images - files of linux system, including kernel, device tree, rootfs, etc.
-> uImage: linux kernel
-> devicetree.dtb: linux devie tree
-> uramdisk.image: linux root file system
-> uEnv: file to configure the MAC address
